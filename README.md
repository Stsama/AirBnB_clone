## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command



- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
